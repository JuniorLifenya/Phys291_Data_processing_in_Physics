**Quantum Dynamics Simulator (C++)**
- Engineered numerical solvers (RK4/FDM) for quantum Hamiltonians
- Visualized quantum states via ROOT and web-based 3D plots

To run the websitemaking compile command: 
./run_website.sh  ← executes ROOT, launches browser




The following way to read / do the exercise and files handed. 

1) MAIN_CPP_CODES folder. Look at the Hamiltonian_FDM_Build, then , Main , then plot_wave, then E_vs_eigenvalues
2) PHASE_SPACE_stuff. Look at wigner_calc_Ground_State_distribution, then my_wigner, then wigner 3D_wigner.cpp, then 3D(python version if you want), ignore plot_wave momentum_density.C
3) Look at MAIN_CPP_CODES folder / RUNGE-Kutta files. I failed to use them, becuase it became complicated for hamiltonian stuff. But i have included examples for their use and outputs 



To run the website type in "make" in WSL(Ubuntu for whindows ) or
            root -q build_site.C ← executes ROOT. 1) MAIN_CPP_CODES folder, look
            at the Hamiltonian_FDM_Build, then , Main , then plot_wave, then
            E_vs_eigenvalues 2) PHASE_SPACE_stuff. Look at
            wigner_calc_Ground_State_distribution, then , my_wigner, then wigner
            3D_wigner.cpp, then 3D(python version if you want), ignore plot_wave
            momentum_density.C 3) Look at MAIN_CPP_CODES folder / RUNGE-Kutta
            files. I failed to use them, becuase it became complicated for
            hamiltonian stuff. I tried some hard stuff with the Runge-Kutta, but
            could not make it good/ beautiful :(. Wanted for eksempel to present
            the time evolution of a wavefunction. But! i have included examples
            for their use and outputs So everything is kind of working trough
            the Main.cpp where it runs and solves for the eigenvalues(aka
            energies) and vectors( aka wave functions). Then it saves
            wavefunction and energies as .dat files so we can visuallly read the
            values there. Plots are generated inside the OUTPUT folder where we
            have the eigenvalues saved as a root file that can be used. I think
            also that the eigenvalues in the output files can be used for this
            plotting but idk how (maybe overthinking ) i mean i kind of did it
            already with. It was hard to ACTUALLY use the runge kutta codes i
            made (it was fun though ). I tried manny different approaches like
            computing the TDSE and kind of plot each wave function probability
            density for different times like snapshot. But that failed badly
            Lastly the PHASE_SPACE folder is also super important. Here we dont
            actually do the wigner distribution function(quasi), so we plot in
            3D, also essentially you can integrate over the wigner function and
            get out a desired probability density function depending on which
            variable you are integrating with respect to ( x, or p). I failed to
            automate stuff i think. But there is still some code that kind of
            run smoothly as long as you know the compile and run commands. These
            are all stored in the Executable_compiled_Binaries. Other codes are
            stuff that i have tried and failed, etcc. I must say that i dont
            remember and understand 100% of all my codes but a good amount of
            them, also it was superfun to read and learn about cpp and its usage
            I just did it my way which i hope is okey, because this is always
            how i learn stuff in my life. Its way more fun for me
            constructing,failing and trying again and again for countless hours
            alone. Since this was so fun i will mostly use my summer to try to
            really master c++ as far as i get. And i will try to rebuild this
            whole project as a speedrun, because why not hahah. The webiste
            stuff is just code i have from other websites i have made for fun
            from before, dont pay too much attention to that code ( maybe look
            at the structure ? is it good , bad ? give me feedback, i love to
            level up ). Well with all that being said, this project is NOT
            really special because i was so unsure all the time what i am TRYING
            to do, so i ended up doing bunch of basic stuff like plotting the
            wavefunc and prob density and comparwing wigen values with harmonic
            version, well well. Hope you enjoid it , and that its enough.Sorry
            for bad english also..i dont care too much about writing good/
            proper report. Just wanted to finish something and have fun hahaha.
